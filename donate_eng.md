# Support for project development
You can support the development of the project in one of the following ways:

## Project support by purchasing a gateway
It is currently possible to buy a DIY version of the gateway assembled by enthusiasts in the [@zigberu] group (https://t.me/zigberu)

## Raising funds to purchase devices
To add support for the SLS Zigbee gateway for new devices, the integration of which is difficult without the presence of the device itself, it was decided to start targeted fundraising using a banking service from Tinkoff. You can add a device to this list through Issues, or by posting through other sources.
